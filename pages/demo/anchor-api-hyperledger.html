    <psk-chapter title="Anchor Web API service">
        <p>
            The web service will expose operations in which, anchors defined as JSON, are stored, updated, fetched or removed. Anchors are expected in the body of the POST request.
            All operations are executed over the Hyperledger fabric network using a smart contract. The smart contract is implemented using ChainCode and deployed on the Hyperledger fabric network.

    <psk-chapter title="User authorization over Hyperledger fabric network">
        When an operation, which requires interaction with the Hyperledger fabric network, is executed, a check is made to ensure that the user which will invoke the smart contract is authorized.
        In case the authorization details are not found, will attempt to obtain the authorization from the network.

    <psk-chapter title="Interactions with Hyperledger fabric network using chaincode">
        The web API will access the interface defined for the smart contract. Based on the invoked method the api will request submitTransaction or evaluateTransaction, which will result in reading or commit information to the ledger.
        In case of success or error, the information will be enclosed in the returned JSON by API. Invoked methods will be made by name, the smart contract will evaluate if the method is implemented and the parameters provided are correct.
